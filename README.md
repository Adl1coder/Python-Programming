# Python Programming 
This Python project contains a Turkish flag with a red background. It also includes a flower and star with different colors.
There is also a telegram bot to understand how it works. All done with the turtle library

# Note:
I had to change the token in the telegram bot so the telegram bot won't work. Other parts are working
