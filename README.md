# Python Programming 
This Python project uses the Turtle graphics library to create a beautiful starry night sky with a red background,
complete with a moon and stars.
The stars are created by mixing different colors to give a sense of depth and variety to the night sky.

# Note:
I had to change the token in the telegram bot so the telegram bot won't work. Other parts are working 

# Screenshoots for Turkish flag and star:
